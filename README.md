# Work -Tracker (Name in Progress)

url - coming soon

## About:
The goal of this app is to track how the user spends their time and send it back into graphed data. This will help to not only goal setting, but aid in overall time management. Great for those of us that either want to be more accountable or already have OCD and want their OCD to look pretty through graphs.

### Tech Used:
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* React.js
* Node.js
* Express
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* Victory.js
* Materialize
* Moment

### Getting Started:
The original idea for this app was to just track the time I spent working to get a role as a junior developer. Then, after seeing a ton of posts in the subreddit Data is Beautiful(http://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful) on New Years where user's submitted records of their entire year in data, I decided to expand beyond just tracking time spent working on jobs and projects and to track all of my activities and track that time.

I really wanted to work with a chart library that would render data I saved to a database as an SVG. I started with D3js, which is pretty much the standard for Javascript data visualization. After a couple days of struggling with tutorials and youtube videos, I figured out that React and D3 are not friends and that there were better partnerships for React. I discovered Victory.js from Formidable and after going through it's walkthrough, I knew it was the graphical partner that React was going to one day Marry.

### Resources:

### To Do:
* CSV upload option (papaparse)
* Goal-Setting
* OAUTH - preferablly Google
* Fitness tracking - Google OAUTH helps with their in-house fitness app
* More graphical representation of data (more VictoryJS)
* Better styling
*
